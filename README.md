Project  : Maintenance Management System

Tagline :  Simplifying Basic Maintenance Needs By using Block Chain and WEB3


The problem it solves :

Complexity: Traditional maintenance management systems can be complex and difficult to navigate. This system simplifies this process, making it more user-friendly.


Efficiency: Basic maintenance tasks can be time-consuming and inefficient without a dedicated system. This system streamlines these tasks, saving time and resources.


Organization: It helps users better organize and track their maintenance needs, preventing oversights and missed tasks.


Accessibility: By being web-based and integrating with MetaMask and Ethereum, it improves accessibility for users who want to manage maintenance tasks online.


Transparency: The blockchain-based system can provide a transparent and immutable record of maintenance activities, enhancing trust and accountability.


User Empowerment: It empowers users to take control of their maintenance processes, reducing dependency on external service providers



Challenges I ran into :


Import ethereums from hardhat testing and it solved by reading the Hardhat Documentation.

Connecting Smart Contracts to our nextJs, it solved by testing various factors by analyzing the smart contract docs.
